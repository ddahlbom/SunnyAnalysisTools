# SunnyAnalysisTools 

This will be a collection of tools that fill in the gap between the [Sunny.jl](https://github.com/SunnySuite/Sunny.jl)
calculator and the fitting of models to neutron scattering data. Currently
contains simples tools for calculating binned intensities, including convolution
across inverse spatial dimensions in momentum space.
